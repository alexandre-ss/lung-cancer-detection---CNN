# Comparative analysis of convolutional neural networks for lung cancer detection in CT scans

A comparative analysis is conducted using the following CNN models for the task of classifying computed tomography scans of the lungs: VGG19, DenseNet, Inception, and Xception. Through the use of these models, the aim is to verify the behavior of CNN models when used in databases with unbalanced and balanced classes of computed tomography scans of the lungs. 

## Dataset
